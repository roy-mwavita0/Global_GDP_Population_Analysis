# üåç Global Socioeconomic Data Analysis: GDP & Population

## üìä Project Overview
This project scrapes, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes **global GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** and **Population data** for over 200 countries. It provides insights into socioeconomic trends through population distribution, GDP comparisons, and the relationship between GDP and population across continents and regions.

### Key Focus:
- GDP estimates from **IMF**, **World Bank**, and **United Nations**.
- Population data for **2022 and 2023**.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Insights on **GDP per capita**, **population trends**, and **regional disparities**.
